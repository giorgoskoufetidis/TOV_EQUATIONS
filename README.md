# TOV Equations Solver

This repository contains Python scripts for solving the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff (TOV) equations, which describe the structure of spherically symmetric bodies in hydrostatic equilibrium under general relativity. These equations are fundamental in modeling neutron stars and other compact objects.

## Repository Contents

- **CRUST.py**: Contains functions related to the crust equation of state (EOS) for neutron stars.
- **EOS.py**: Defines barotropic equations of state used in the TOV solutions.
- **Ploting.py**: Includes functions for plotting the results of the TOV solutions.
- **Solve.py**: Main script that integrates the TOV equations using specified EOS models.
- **TOV_plots.md**: Markdown file showcasing plots generated from the TOV solutions.
- **TOV_results_for_multiple_models.txt**: Text file of data for each barotropic equation of state.
- **Figure_1.png** & **Figure_2.png**: Graphical representations of the M-R diagrams.
