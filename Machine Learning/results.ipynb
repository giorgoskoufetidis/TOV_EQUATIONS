    "## Results\n",
    "- **Random Forest** performed the best in terms of overall accuracy and f1-score across all sample sizes.\n",
    "- **Decision Tree** also showed strong results, but with slightly lower accuracy compared to Random Forest.\n",
    "- **KNN** had the lowest accuracy and f1-scores, indicating it may not be the best choice for this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Based on this analysis, **Random Forest** is the most effective classifier for this dataset, followed by Decision Tree. KNN performed the weakest, suggesting that it may not generalize well for this classification problem.\n",
